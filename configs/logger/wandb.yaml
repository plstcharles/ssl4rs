wandb:
  _target_: pytorch_lightning.loggers.wandb.WandbLogger
  name: ${experiment_name} # the display name for the run; in wandb-speak, run = experiment
  save_dir: ${utils.output_dir_prefix}/wandb/ # root where all wandb data will be logged
  offline: False # toggles whether to run offline and upload data later if needed
  version: ${utils.run_and_job_name} # can be used to set the ID of a previous exec to resume it
  anonymous: True # enables or explicitly disables anonymous logging
  project: ${utils.project_name} # name of the project to which this run will belong
  log_model: False # toggles whether to log checkpoints created by callbacks as artifacts
  prefix: "" # the string to prefix to all metric keys that will be logged
  # note: we also add more args to pass more arguments directly to wandb.init
  # entity: null  # username or team where we'll be sending all our runs
  group: ${run_name} # group name under which we'll be adding this run
  job_type: ${run_type} # type of run we'll be doing (used to facilitate filtering in the UI)
  tags: [] # a list of tags to use for this run (used to facilitate filtering in the UI)
