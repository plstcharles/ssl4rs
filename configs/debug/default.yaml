# This config will be loaded in all debug sessions in order to simplify the debugging process!
# (we'll run single-epoch training sessions with deterministic behavior and verbose settings)

defaults:
  - override /output: debug.yaml
  - override /data: debug.yaml
  - override /callbacks: debug.yaml
  - override /logger: debug.yaml
  - override /trainer: debug.yaml

hydra:
  verbose: True  # this will set the level of all command line loggers to 'DEBUG' for max verbosity

utils:
  print_config: True  # toggles whether to pretty-print the config at the start of the run
  ignore_warnings: False  # let's always enable all warnings by default in the debug configs
  log_installed_pkgs: True  # always log all installed packages in the python env to the output dir
  log_runtime_tags: True  # always log all runtime tags (e.g. platform name) to the output dir

seed: 1337  # seed is set to a fixed number by default to also make sure the RNG behavior is static
seed_workers: True  # will initialize workers with the above seed as well
